1. When the C code for the compiler comes to the 'login' command, it would compile so that the command would actually take a pre-determined password (presumably only Ken Thompson knew), or the intended encrypted password. However, this is obvious in the source code. So he had to do something to make it less obvious. Then the source code of the C compiler is modified to recognize a second pattern and inserts self-reproducing code that inserts both Trojan horses into the compiled compiler. Then both Trojans can be removed from the source code and the bugged compiler will still generate the workaround 'login' on every compile.
2. Depending on how serious the compromise is. First thing I would do is disconnect from the network to prevent whatever compromised the computer to spread. A simple anti-malware might get rid of it. If that's not enough, wiping the hard drive and reinstalling the OS would also be good. If for some reason the compromise was even lower level in the CPU, get new hardware.
3. Assembler. Linker. Text Editors that we code in. Ssh. Scp.
