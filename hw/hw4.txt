The MAC extension attack works because of the way certain hash algorithms work. In the kinds of HMACs that an extension attack would work on, the MAC is generated by hashing the message concatenated with a shared secret key. An extension attack utilizes the fact that the output of these kinds of hashes is the state of the hash algorithm. This means that the attacker is able to use the intercepted MAC as the new state to calculate the new hash of the new, extended, message. This can be done by using the intercepted MAC as the current state and hashing the extension concatenated with the padding. Since the hash algorithms reads in the data in chunks (usually in 512 bits), all the attacker has to do is pad the end of the original message with enough 0x00s to reach the end of a 512 bit block and append the size of the original message plus the key. The key length can be obtained by the hacker by querying the server with different key lengths until an error is returned signifying the message was authenticated. The attacker takes the original message, pads the end with 0x00s and the size, then appends whatever message he/she wants and finally appends the new MAC.
